# Office-Management Project
This program’s purpose is to let users sign in to their username and 
password provided by the admin. The admin will then be able to task the 
employees that can be viewed by the user. The admin will be able to see the 
employee’s data, such as salary, position, name, age, gender. After the tasks are 
done, the employees can report to the admin that they’re done. They can also apply 
for leaves through this program.
